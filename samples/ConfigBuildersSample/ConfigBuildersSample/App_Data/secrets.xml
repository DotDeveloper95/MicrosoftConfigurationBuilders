<!--
    This sample secrets.xml file exists in App_Data. Which is obviously checked into source control
    for the purpose of being a sample. It is recommended that you reference a secrets file that exists
    outside of your souce control for development configurations. Using 'userSecretsId' and the
    "Manage User Secrets" feature of Visual Studio will make that easier than directly
    specifying a file via 'userSecretsFile'.
